# bufferCount

#### signature: `bufferCount(bufferSize: number, startBufferEvery: number = null): Observable`

## Collect emitted values until provided number is fulfilled, emit as array.

### Why use `bufferCount`?
The key distinction between bufferCount and other buffering operators lies in its count-based buffering approach. Upon reaching the specified count of emissions, bufferCount groups and emits the values as an array. Think of it as collecting items in groups of the specified count.

This operator proves advantageous in scenarios where processing data in chunks is more efficient, such as bulk updates or batch processing. By contrast, the buffer operator relies on a closing notifier to define the buffering window, which may not suit all use cases.

Keep in mind, though, that bufferCount may not be the best choice when the buffering strategy requires time-based or event-driven windows. In such instances, consider using [buffer](buffer.md) or [buffertime](bufferTime.md) instead. Remember, bufferCount organizes values based on emission count, as illustrated clearly in the first example.

Exercise caution in situations where buffering strategy plays a critical role in the desired output, as choosing the wrong operator might lead to unexpected behavior. Familiarize yourself with the various buffering operators to make informed decisions based on your specific requirements.

### Examples

##### Example 1: Collect buffer and emit after specified number of values

| [jsBin](http://jsbin.com/suveqaromu/1/edit?js,console) |
[jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/btroncone/ky9myc5b/) )

```js
// RxJS v6+
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { bufferCount } from 'rxjs/operators';

//Create an observable that emits a value every second
const source = interval(1000);
//After three values are emitted, pass on as an array of buffered values
const bufferThree = source.pipe(bufferCount(3));
//Print values to console
//ex. output [0,1,2]...[3,4,5]
const subscribe = bufferThree.subscribe(val =>
  console.log('Buffered Values:', val)
);
```

##### Example 2: Overlapping buffers

[jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/btroncone/3c67qcz1/) )

```js
// RxJS v6+
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { bufferCount } from 'rxjs/operators';

//Create an observable that emits a value every second
const source = interval(1000);
/*
bufferCount also takes second argument, when to start the next buffer
for instance, if we have a bufferCount of 3 but second argument (startBufferEvery) of 1:
1st interval value:
buffer 1: [0]
2nd interval value:
buffer 1: [0,1]
buffer 2: [1]
3rd interval value:
buffer 1: [0,1,2] Buffer of 3, emit buffer
buffer 2: [1,2]
buffer 3: [2]
4th interval value:
buffer 2: [1,2,3] Buffer of 3, emit buffer
buffer 3: [2, 3]
buffer 4: [3]
*/
const bufferEveryOne = source.pipe(bufferCount(3, 1));
//Print values to console
const subscribe = bufferEveryOne.subscribe(val =>
  console.log('Start Buffer Every 1:', val)
);
```

##### Example 3: Last n keyboard presses tracking

)

```js
// RxJS v6+
import { fromEvent, of } from 'rxjs';
import { bufferCount, map, mergeMap, tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

const fakeKeyPressesPost = keypresses =>
  of(201).pipe(
    tap(_ => {
      console.log(`received key presses are: ${keypresses}`);
      document.getElementById('output').innerText = keypresses;
    })
  );

fromEvent(document, 'keydown')
  .pipe(
    map((e: KeyboardEvent) => e.key),
    bufferCount(5),
    mergeMap(fakeKeyPressesPost)
  )
  .subscribe();
```
