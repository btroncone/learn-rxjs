# RxJS Primer

Brand new to RxJS? In this article we will take a crash course through all the
major concepts you will need to begin getting a grasp on, and start being
productive with RxJS. Hold on tight and let's get started!

## What is an Observable?

An observable represents a stream, or source of data that can arrive over time.
You can create an observable from nearly anything, but the most common use case
in RxJS is from events. This can be anything from mouse moves, button clicks,
input into a text field, or even route changes. The easiest way to create an
observable is through the built in creation functions. For example, we can use
the [`fromEvent`](../operators/creation/fromevent.md) helper function to create
an observable of mouse click events:

```js
// import the fromEvent operator
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

// grab button reference
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

// create an observable of button clicks
const myObservable = fromEvent(button, 'click');
```

At this point we have an observable but it's not doing anything. **This is
because observables are cold, or do not activate a producer (like wiring up an
event listener), until there is a...**

## Subscription

Subscriptions are what set everything in motion. You can think of this like a
faucet, you have a stream of water ready to be tapped (observable), someone just
needs to turn the handle. In the case of observables, that role belongs to the
`subscriber`.

To create a subscription, you call the `subscribe` method, supplying a function
(or object) - also known as an `observer`. This is where you can decide how to
**react**(-ive programming) to each event. Let's walk through what happens in
the previous scenario when a subscription is created:

```js
// import the fromEvent operator
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

// grab button reference
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

// create an observable of button clicks
const myObservable = fromEvent(button, 'click');

// for now, let's just log the event on each click
const subscription = myObservable.subscribe(event => console.log(event));
```

In the example above, calling `myObservable.subscribe()` will:

1. Set up an event listener on our button for click events.
2. Call the function we passed to the subscribe method (observer) on each click
   event.
3. Return a subscription object with an `unsubscribe` which contains clean up
   logic, like removing appropriate event listeners.

The subscribe method also accepts an object map to handle the case of error or
completion. You probably won't use this as much as simply supplying a function,
but it's good to be aware of should the need arise:

```js
// instead of a function, we will pass an object with next, error, and complete methods
const subscription = myObservable.subscribe({
  // on successful emissions
  next: event => console.log(event),
  // on errors
  error: error => console.log(error),
  // called once on completion
  complete: () => console.log('complete!')
});
```

It's important to note that each subscription will create a new execution
context. This means calling `subscribe` a second time will create a new event
listener:

```js
// addEventListener called
const subscription = myObservable.subscribe(event => console.log(event));

// addEvent listener called again!
const secondSubscription = myObservable.subscribe(event => console.log(event));

// clean up with unsubscribe
subscription.unsubscribe();
secondSubscription.unsubscribe();
```

By default, a subscription creates a one on one, one-sided conversation between
the observable and observer. This is like your boss (the observable) yelling
(emitting) at you (the observer) for merging a bad PR. This is also known as
**unicasting**. If you prefer a conference talk scenario - one observable, many
observers - you will take a different approach which includes **multicasting**
with `Subjects` (either explicitly or behind the scenes). More on that in a
future article!

It's worth noting that when we discuss an Observable source emitting data to
observers, this is a push based model. The source doesn't know or care what
subscribers do with the data, it simply pushes it down the line.

While working on a stream of events is nice, it's only so useful on it's own.
**What makes RxJS the "lodash for events" are its...**

## Operators

Operators offer a way to manipulate values from a source, returning an
observable of the transformed values. Many of the RxJS operators will look
familiar if you are used to JavaScripts `Array` methods. For instance, if you
want to transform emitted values from an observable source, you can use
[`map`](../operators/transformation/map.md):

```js
// import the from operator
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';
/*
 *  'of' allows you to deliver values in a sequence
 *  In this case, it will emit 1,2,3,4,5 in order.
 */
const dataSource = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// subscribe to our source observable
const subscription = dataSource
  .pipe(
    // add 1 to each emitted value
    map(value => value + 1)
  )
  // log: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
  .subscribe(value => console.log(value));
```

Or if you want to filter for specific values, you can use
[`filter`](../operators/filtering/filter.md):

```js
// import the from operator
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { filter } from 'rxjs/operators';

const dataSource = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// subscribe to our source observable
const subscription = dataSource
  .pipe(
    // only accept values 2 or greater
    filter(value => value >= 2)
  )
  // log: 2, 3, 4, 5
  .subscribe(value => console.log(value));
```

In practice, if there is a problem you need to solve, it's more than likely
**there is an operator for that**. And while the sheer number of operators can
be overwhelming as you begin your RxJS journey, you can narrow it down to a
small handful (and we will) to start being effective. Over time, you will come
to appreciate the flexibility of the operator library when obscure scenarios
inevitably arrive.

**One thing you may have noticed in the example above, is operators exist within
a...**

## Pipe

The `pipe` function is the assembly line from your observable data source
through your operators. Just like raw material in a factory goes through a
series of stops before it becomes a finished product, source data can pass
through a `pipe`-line of operators where you can manipulate, filter, and
transform the data to fit your use case. It's not uncommon to use 5 (or more)
operators within an observable chain, contained within the `pipe` function.

For instance, a typeahead solution built with observables may use a group of
operators to optimize both the request and display process:

```js
// observable of values from a text box, pipe chains operators together
inputValue
  .pipe(
    // wait for a 200ms pause
    debounceTime(200),
    // if the value is the same, ignore
    distinctUntilChanged(),
    // if an updated value comes through while request is still active cancel previous request and 'switch' to new observable
    switchMap(searchTerm => typeaheadApi.search(term))
  )
  // create a subscription
  .subscribe(results => {
    // update the dom
  });
```

**But how do you know which operator fits your use-case? The good news is...**

## Operators can be grouped into common categories

The first stop when looking for the correct operator is finding a related
category. Need to filter data from a source? Check out the
[`filtering`](../operators/filtering/README.md) operators. Trying to track down
a bug, or debug the flow of data through your observable stream? There are
[`utility`](../operators/utility/README.md) operators that will do the trick.
**The operator categories include...**

### [Creation operators](../operators/creation/README.md)

These operators allow the creation of an observable from nearly anything. From
generic to specific use-cases you are free to turn everything into a stream.

For example, suppose we are creating a progress bar as a user scrolls through an
article. We could turn the scroll event into a stream by utilizing the
[`fromEvent`](../operators/creation/fromevent.md) operator:

```js
fromEvent(scrollContainerElement, 'scroll')
  .pipe(
    // we will discuss cleanup strategies like this in future article
    takeUntil(userLeavesArticle)
  )
  .subscribe(event => {
    // calculate and update DOM
  });
```

The most commonly used creation operators are
[`of`](../operators/creation/of.md), [`from`](../operators/creation/from.md),
and [`fromEvent`](../operators/creation/fromevent.md).

### [Combination operators](../operators/combination/README.md)

The combination operators allow the joining of information from multiple
observables. Order, time, and structure of emitted values is the primary
variation among these operators.

For example, we can combine updates from multiple data sources to perform a
calculation:

```js
// give me the last emitted value from each source, whenever either source emits
combineLatest(sourceOne, sourceTwo).subscribe(
  ([latestValueFromSourceOne, latestValueFromSourceTwo]) => {
    // perform calculation
  }
);
```

The most commonly used combination operators are
[`combineLatest`](../operators/combination/combinelatest.md),
[`concat`](../operators/combination/concat.md),
[`merge`](../operators/combination/merge.md),
[`startWith`](../operators/combination/startwith.md), and
[`withLatestFrom`](../operators/combination/withlatestfrom.md).

### [Error handling operators](../operators/error_handling/README.md)

The error handling operators provide effective ways to gracefully handle errors
and perform retries, should they occur.

For example, we can use
[`catchError`](../operators/error_handling/catcherror.md) to safeguard against
failed network requests:

```js
source
  .pipe(
    mergeMap(value => {
      return makeRequest(value).pipe(
        catchError(handleErrorByReturningObservable)
      );
    })
  )
  .subscribe(value => {
    // take action
  });
```

The most commonly used error handling operators is
[`catchError`](../operators/error_handling/catcherror.md).

### [Filtering operators](../operators/filtering/README.md)

The filtering operators provide techniques for accepting - or declining - values
from an observable source and dealing with backpressure, or the build up of
values within a stream.

For example, we can use the [`take`](../operators/filtering/take.md) operator to
capture only the first `5` emitted values from a source:

```js
source.pipe(take(5)).subscribe(value => {
  // take action
});
```

The most commonly used filtering operators are
[`debounceTime`](../operators/filtering/debouncetime),
[`distinctUntilChanged`](../operators/filtering/distinctuntilchanged),
[`filter`](../operators/filtering/filter),
[`take`](../operators/filtering/take), and
[`takeUntil`](../operators/filtering/takeuntil).

### [Multicasting operators](../operators/multicasting/README.md)

In RxJS observables are cold, or unicast (one source per subscriber) by default.
These operators can make an observable hot, or multicast, allowing side-effects
to be shared among multiple subscribers.

For example, we may want late subscribers to share, and receive the last emitted
value from an active source:

```js
const source = data.pipe(shareReplay());

const firstSubscriber = source.subscribe(value => {
  // perform some action
});

// sometime later...

// second subscriber gets last emitted value on subscription, shares execution context with 'firstSubscriber'
const secondSubscriber = source.subscribe(value => {
  // perform some action
});
```

The most commonly used multicasting operator is
[`shareReplay`](../operators/multicasting/sharereplay.md).

### [Transformation operators](../operators/transformation/README.md)

Transforming values as they pass through an operator chain is a common task.
These operators provide transformation techniques for nearly any use-case you
will encounter.

For example, we may want to accumulate a state object from a source over time,
similar to [Redux](https://redux.js.org/):

```js
source
  .pipe(
    scan((accumulatedState, currentState) => {
      return { ...accumulatedState, ...currentState };
    })
  )
  .subscribe();
```

The most commonly used transformation operators are
[`concatMap`](../operators/transformation/concatmap.md),
[`map`](../operators/transformation/map.md),
[`mergeMap`](../operators/transformation/mergemap.md),
[`scan`](../operators/transformation/scan.md), and
[`switchMap`](../operators/transformation/switchmap.md).

## Operators have common behaviors

While operators can be grouped into common categories, operators within a
category often share common behavior. By recognizing this common behavior you
can start creating a
[_'choose your own operator'_ tree](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/operator-decision-tree)
in your mind.

**For instance, a large amount of operators can grouped into...**

#### Operators that flatten

Or, in other words, operators that manage the subscription of an inner
observable, emitting those values into a single observable source. One common
use case for flattening operators is handling HTTP requests in a observable or
promise based API, but that is really just scratching the surface:

```js
fromEvent(button, 'click')
  .pipe(
    mergeMap(value => {
      // this 'inner' subscription is managed by mergeMap, with response value emitted to observer
      return makeHttpRequest(value);
    })
  )
  .subscribe(response => {
    // do something
  });
```

**We can then divide the flattening operators into common behaviors like...**

#### Operators that `switch`

Like a light switch, `switch` based operators will turn off (unsubscribe) the
current observable and turn on a new observable on emissions from the source.
Switch operators are useful in situations you don't want (or need) more than one
active observable at a time:

```js
inputValueChanges
  // only the last value is important, if new value comes through cancel previous request / observable
  .pipe(
    // make GET request for data
    switchMap(requestObservable)
  )
  .subscribe();
```

Switch based operators include `switchAll`,
[`switchMap`](../operators/transformation/switchmap.md), and
[`switchMapTo`](../operators/transformation/switchmapto.md).

#### Operators that `concat`

Comparable to a line at the ATM machine, the next transaction can't begin until
the previous completes. In observable terms, only one subscription will occur at
a time, in order, triggered by the completion of the previous. These are useful
in situations where order of execution is important:

```js
concat(
  firstObservable,
  // will begin when 'firstObservable` completes
  secondObservable,
  // will begin when 'secondObservable` completes
  thirdObservable
).subscribe(values => {
  // take action
});
```

Merge based operators include [`concat`](../operators/combination/concat.md),
[`concatAll`](../operators/combination/concatall.md),
[`concatMap`](../operators/transformation/concatmap.md), and
[`concatMapTo`](../operators/transformation/concatmapto.md).

#### Operators that `merge`

Like your merging lane on the interstate, merge based operators support multiple
active observables flowing into one lane in a first come first serve basis.
Merge operators are useful in situations where you want to trigger an action
when an event from one of many sources occurs:

```js
merge(firstObservable, secondObservable)
  // any emissions from first or second observable as they occur
  .pipe(mergeMap(saveActivity))
  .subscribe();
```

Merge based operators include [`merge`](../operators/combination/merge.md),
[`mergeMap`](../operators/transformation/mergemap.md), `mergeMapTo` and
[`mergeAll`](../operators/combination/mergeall.md).

## Other similarities between operators

There are also operators that share a similar goal but offer flexibility in
their triggers. For instance, for unsubscribing from an observable after a
specific condition is met, we could use:

1. [`take`](../operators/filtering/take.md) when we know we only ever want `x`
   values.
2. [`takeLast`](../operators/filtering/takelast.md) when you just want the last
   n values.
3. [`takeWhile`](../operators/filtering/takewhile.md) when we have a predicate
   expression to supply.
4. [`takeUntil`](../operators/filtering/takeuntil.md) when we only want the
   source to remain active until another source emits.

While the number of RxJS operators can seem overhelming at first, these common
behaviors and patterns can bridge the gap rather quickly while learning RxJS.

## What does this get me?

As you become more familiar with push based programming through Observables, you
can begin to model all async behavior in your applications through observable
streams. This opens up simple solutions and flexibility for notably complex
behavior.

For instance, suppose we wanted to make a request which saved user activity when
they answered a quiz question. Our initial implementation may use the
[`mergeMap`](../opearators/transformation/mergemap.md) operator, which fires off
a save request on each event:

```js
const formEvents = fromEvent(formField, 'click');
const subscription = formEvents
  .pipe(
    map(convertToAppropriateValue),
    mergeMap(saveRequest)
  )
  .subscribe();
```

Later, it's determined that we need to ensure order of these saves. Armed with
the knowledge of operator behavior from above, instead of implementing a complex
queueing system we can instead replace the
[`mergeMap`](../operators/transformation/mergemap.md) operator with
[`concatMap`](../operators/transformation/concatmap.md) and push up our changes:

```js
const formEvents = fromEvent(formField, 'click');
const subscription = formEvents
  .pipe(
    map(convertToAppropriateValue),
    // now the next request won't begin until the previous completes
    concatMap(saveRequest)
  )
  .subscribe();
```

With the change of one word we are now queueing our event requests, and this is
just scratching the surface of what is possible!

## Keep Going!

Learning RxJS can be intimidating, but it's a path I promise is worth the
investment. If some of these concepts are still fuzzy (or make no sense at
all!), don't worry! It will all click soon.

examples and use-cases, as well as the additional
