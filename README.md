# Learn RxJS

Clear examples, explanations, and resources for RxJS.


## Introduction

[RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) is one of the hottest libraries in web development today. Offering a powerful, functional approach for dealing with events and with integration points into a growing number of frameworks, libraries, and utilities, 
the case for learning Rx has never been more appealing. Couple this with the ability to utilize your knowledge across [nearly any language](http://reactivex.io/languages.html), 
having a solid grasp on reactive programming and what it can offer seems like a no-brainer.

**But...**

Learning RxJS and reactive programming is [hard](https://twitter.com/hoss/status/742643506536153088). There's the multitude of concepts, large API surface, and fundamental shift in mindset 
from an [imperative to declarative style](http://codenugget.co/2015/03/05/declarative-vs-imperative-programming-web.html). This site focuses on making these concepts approachable, the examples clear and easy to explore, 
and features references throughout to the best RxJS related material on the web. 
The goal is to supplement the [official docs](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/) and pre-existing learning material while offering a new, fresh perspective to clear any hurdles and tackle the pain points. 
Learning Rx may be difficult but it is certainly worth the effort!

## Content

#### Operators
Operators are the horse-power behind observables, providing an elegant, declarative solution to complex asynchronous tasks.
This section contains all [RxJS 5 operators](/operators/README.md), included with clear, executable examples in both [JSBin](https://jsbin.com) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net). Links to additional resources and recipes for each operator are also provided, when applicable.  

##### Categories
* [Combination](/operators/combination/README.md)
* [Conditional](/operators/conditional/README.md)
* [Creation](/operators/creation/README.md)
* [Error Handling](/operators/error_handling/README.md)
* [Multicasting](/operators/multicasting/README.md)
* [Filtering](/operators/filtering/README.md)
* [Transformation](/operators/transformation/README.md)
* [Utility](/operators/utility/README.md)

#### Concepts
Without a solid base knowledge of how Observables work behind the scenes, it's easy for much of RxJS to feel like 'magic'.
This section helps solidify the major concepts needed to feel comfortable with reactive programming and Observables.

*Coming Soon!*

#### Recipes
Recipes, use-cases, and best-practices are included for solving common problems and scenarios with RxJS. 

*Coming Soon!*
